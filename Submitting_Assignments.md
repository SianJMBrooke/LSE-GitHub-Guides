# Computational Courses: How to submit your assignments.

This document contains a guide for submitting your files for computational assignments, such as working on Python notebooks (.ipynb or .py) or R files (.Rmd or .R).

Think of GitHub like DropBox or OneDrive. It is a remote storage location where we can keep track of our files, store projects, and collaberate. GitHub also keeps track of 
every change you make, meaning that you do not need to rename files. Think of GitHub working like Tracked Changes in Microsoft Word.

The important bit to remember is to check that your submission is visible in the browser, to make sure we can see it, before the deadline. On my blog, [you can find a 
detailed visualisation](https://www.sianbrooke.co.uk/dr-brookes-blog/coding-in-python-understanding-how-everything-fits-together) of how the langages and various technologies fit together. 
Whilst this focuses on Python, GitHub works in the same way for every programming language.

GitHub can be intimidating at first, but it is great resource and when you work in Data Science or Computational research, people you are working with will likely presume that you are
familuar with it. Whilst you can use GitHub on the command line (Terminal) or the Kraken GUI (Desktop App), it is completely fine to use the Web Interface, and this doesn't make you any
less of a programmer. How you submit you assignments to GitHub is not part of your grade, and we won't check if you do it one way or another.

Your course instructors will email you a link (URL) to click on in order to access the assignment. You will see your own Repository (or Repo, GitHub Project) has been created with the name
the assignment (i.e. Problem-Set-1) and your username, looking something like *Problem-Set-1-SianJMBrooke*. This is your own copy of the assignment, and where we will mark your work.
Only you and the instructors can see this Repo. 

Becuase GitHub tracks the changes you make to your work, you should not rename your files. For example, you should not have "problem-set-1-final-finally-final.R". 
If you rename your file this can lead to delays in your work being marked as it won't be automatically downloaded for feedback. You will recieve comments and a mark in the same way on this
repo. You can preview you marked file on GitHub, or download it to see how you did!

The key points are:
- You need to download (pull) your assignments from GitHub
- You should work with the files on your computer
- When you are ready, upload (comment/push) to the same location you downloaded them from.
- **Check you can see you completed assignment on GitHub in your browser before the deadline.**

There is amble help in this folder, with each of the different ways that you can use GitHub. If you get stuck, the GitHub help pages are a great resource.
